# image-classification
Image classification is a computer vision task where an algorithm is trained to assign labels or categories to images. The goal is to teach a model to recognize patterns or features in images that correspond to predefined classes. For example, a model could classify an image as containing a cat, dog, car, or airplane.

Applications of Image Classification:

Healthcare: Detecting diseases in medical images (e.g., X-rays, MRIs).

Autonomous Vehicles: Identifying objects like pedestrians, vehicles, and traffic signs.

Retail: Product recognition in e-commerce or shelf monitoring.

Security: Facial recognition or identifying unauthorized objects.

Social Media: Content moderation or tagging images.
