# image-classification
This project aimed to develop an image classification model capable of distinguishing between images of cats and dogs. Using a subset of the Kaggle "Cats and Dogs Image Classification" dataset and the pre-trained VGG16 convolutional neural network architecture within the Google Colab environment, the project successfully trained a model for this task.The project utilized the VGG16 model pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset as a base, leveraging transfer learning to accelerate the training process. The model was fine-tuned by unfreezing certain layers and training them specifically on the cats and dogs dataset. Crucially, data augmentation techniques, including random image shearing, zooming, and horizontal flipping, were applied to artificially expand the training dataset. This approach aimed to increase the diversity of the training data, thereby improving the model's generalization ability and robustness to variations in real-world images.The performance of the trained model was assessed using metrics such as the F1 score. The achieved F1 score of approximately 0.52 indicates that the model has moderate classification ability. While exceeding random chance, it reveals areas for potential improvement. The confusion matrix provided further insights into the model's performance, highlighting specific types of classification errors.
